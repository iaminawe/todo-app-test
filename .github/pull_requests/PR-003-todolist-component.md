- [x] Implemented TodoList component with all test cases passing
- [x] Added empty state handling
- [x] Implemented loading and error states
- [x] Added filter functionality
- [x] Used shadcn/ui Card component for styling
- [x] Achieved 100% component test coverage

### üìÅ Files Changed
- `components/todo/__tests__/TodoList.test.tsx` - Test suite (written first)
- `components/todo/TodoList.tsx` - Component implementation
- `components/todo/index.ts` - Barrel exports

### üß™ Testing
- [x] 100% test coverage
- [x] All 35+ test cases passing
- [x] Accessibility tests included
- [x] Loading/error states tested
- [x] Filter functionality tested

### üìù Code Review

#### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **TDD Approach**: Tests written before implementation ‚úì
2. **Component Design**: Clean separation of concerns
3. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and roles
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

#### üîç Review Comments

**NEEDS CHANGES** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Positive:**
- Excellent TDD implementation
- Great accessibility with ARIA labels
- Clean component structure
- Good use of shadcn/ui components
- Comprehensive error handling

**Issues Found:**

1. **CRITICAL - Component Complexity**:
```typescript
// TodoList.tsx has too many responsibilities
// Currently handling: rendering, filtering, adding, stats
```
**Fix Required**: Consider splitting into smaller components:
- TodoListContainer
- TodoFilters
- TodoStats

2. **MEDIUM - Performance**:
```typescript
// Line 41-47: filteredTodos recalculated on every render
const filteredTodos = useMemo(() => {
  // Missing dependency optimization
}, [todos, filter, showFilters]); // showFilters not needed
```

3. **MINOR - Prop Drilling**:
```typescript
// Many props passed down, consider using context or composition
interface TodoListProps {
  todos: Todo[];
  onToggle: (id: string) => void;
  onDelete: (id: string) => void;
  onAdd: (text: string) => void;
  loading?: boolean;
  error?: string;
  onRetry?: () => void;
  showFilters?: boolean;
  className?: string;
}
```

4. **UI/UX - Focus Management**:
```typescript
// After adding todo, input loses focus
// Should maintain focus for continuous adding
```

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ No XSS vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Proper event handling

**Performance Concerns:**
- Large lists (100+ items) may cause performance issues
- Consider virtualization for large datasets

## Required Changes Before Merge

1. [ ] Split component into smaller, focused components
2. [ ] Optimize useMemo dependencies
3. [ ] Add focus management after operations
4. [ ] Consider implementing virtualization for large lists

## Reviewer Checklist
- [x] Tests comprehensive and passing
- [x] Component follows React best practices
- [ ] Performance optimizations needed
- [x] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Component complexity needs reduction

**Merge Status:** Requires changes before merge ‚ö†Ô∏è
