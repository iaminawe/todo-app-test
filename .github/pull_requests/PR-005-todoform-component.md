#### 🔍 Review Comments

**APPROVED WITH EXCELLENCE** 🌟

**Exceptional Work:**
- Outstanding test coverage (60+ tests!)
- Perfect TDD execution
- Excellent error handling with try-catch
- Smart use of refs for focus management
- Great UX with character count
- Async submission support

**Minor Enhancements Suggested:**

1. **Debouncing for Validation**:
```typescript
// Current: Validation on every keystroke
// Consider: Debounced validation for better performance
const debouncedValidate = useMemo(
  () => debounce(validateTodoText, 300),
  []
);
```

2. **Success Feedback**:
```typescript
// Consider adding success feedback
const [successMessage, setSuccessMessage] = useState<string | null>(null);
// "Todo added successfully!" - auto-dismiss after 2s
```

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
```typescript
// Consider Ctrl+Enter for submit (useful for multiline in future)
onKeyDown={(e) => {
  if (e.ctrlKey && e.key === 'Enter') {
    handleSubmit(e);
  }
}}
```

4. **Custom Validation**:
```typescript
interface TodoFormProps {
  // Consider adding:
  validate?: (text: string) => string | null; // Custom validation
  transformBeforeSubmit?: (text: string) => string; // Custom transform
}
```

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Clean, readable code
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Good use of React hooks
- ✅ TypeScript types comprehensive

**Performance:**
- ✅ No unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Proper use of useRef for DOM access
- ⚠️ Consider debouncing validation for very long text

**Security:**
- ✅ Input sanitization via utils
- ✅ No XSS vulnerabilities
- ✅ Proper error message escaping
